## How do I execute a test case?
First you have to choose a test case in the [Test Navigator](/te_markdown/terminology#test-navigator). E.g. you want to start the testcase named `CreateHero.tcl`, select the test case with your mouse and click the *play* button in the left upper corner of the [Test Execution Navigator](/te_markdown/terminology#test-execution-navigator).

When the test case is started, you can see the execution of the single test steps.  
After test execution you can browse the logs, and screenshots in the [Test Execution Details](/te_markdown/terminology#test-execution-details).
